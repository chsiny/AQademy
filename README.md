Introduction: \
AQademy is an online discussion platform that empowers students to ask questions and participate in forum-based discussions. Instructors can moderate discussions and endorse accurate answers, and students can upvote the answers they find helpful. This platform aims to enhance student engagement and promote active learning, revolutionizing the way students interact with their coursework. \
Objectives: \
This web-based application project will be built with a focus on implementing the MVC design pattern and deploying it on the UQCloud. It is designed with a variety of features that aim to enhance the user experience. Users can post questions anonymously or with their names, and only the teaching team has the authority to make them private and viewable. Additionally, our platform allows users to like, comment, and post questions, and upvote answers. \
Each course will have its discussion forum, students can enroll in courses to post questions and answer questions. Users can search for relevant posts by using keywords or filters such as most upvoted, most recent, most comments, etc. Moreover, They can also comment on a post, or they can bookmark a post. Both ways will enable them to receive any updated notification about that post. \
This project will utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and AJAX to develop a responsive front-end interface with an intuitive user experience. The back end will be developed by using PHP, CodeIgniter, and MySQL to process requests, communicate with the database, and generate dynamic content on the client side. \
